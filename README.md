# Signal-Installation-Tour
Finally, I have successfully built the Signal.

# 1. Signal Server
# 2. Signal Contact Discovery Service
    a. Intel SGX
        - Link github: https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx.git
        - Before install SGX, you need to check your hardware, it need to support SGX2 by the tool:
        https://github.com/ayeks/SGX-hardware
        - You can use MS Azure cloud, Ubuntu 18.04, it supports SGX2 and now , I'm using it for my product.
        - If your hardware support SGX, install Intel SGX by steps:
            . Install SGX Driver: https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx-driver (Note: check out branch sgx2)
            . Install SGX PSW
            . ECDSA attestation and SGX SDK you do not need to.
    b. CDS installation
        - Git clone https://github.com/signalapp/ContactDiscoveryService.git
        - make -C enclave (Or you can run with sudo)
        - The most important thing is change .yml config file
        # Config CDS file
        https://github.com/iamdatvt94/Signal-Installation-Tour/blob/master/CDS-config.yml
        - You need to subscribe IntelÂ® SGX Attestation Service Utilizing Enhanced Privacy ID
        https://api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/
         -> go to Development Access (unlinkable)
         -> you can get spid and iasSecretKey
        - mrenclave:
            . after run command make -C enclave. you cd to folder: service/src/main/resource/enclave/ and can get *.so file
            -> file's name is mrenclave value
        - redis config: you setup redis (cluster 3 nodes) and setup sentinel 
            Ex: https://www.inovex.de/blog/redis-sentinel-make-your-dataset-highly-available/
        - sqs:
            . Set up you sqs in amazon , note it must be fifo type
        - Start CDS service
            . CDS will running on port 8000
            . Signal service only using CDS with https url
            . Your must be set url to https and get it's certificate for using in Signal service and Client (android, ios,...)
     c. Signal service installation
# 3. Signal Android
